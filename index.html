						<h1>Mutation explosion post 2006-ish</h1>
						<p>'Every man and his dog' starting making new databases, most of them for a new model.</p>
						<p>Literally 100's of datastores to choose from since ~2015. A few competing to be the same as others just bigger, better and faster; Most a unique shape of their own.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Many developers started understanding how databases were composed - write-ahead logs, b-trees, lock-free algorithms, memory vs disk representations, logical clocks, etc. - and took those ingredients and composed new datastores.</p>

						<h1>Reduce your requirements, find more options on the shelf</h1>
					</section>
					<section>
						<ul>
							<li>Don't need disk persistence? Enjoy in-memory speed.</li>
							<li>Dataset fits into one server? (Say 1TB RAM, 10TB disk) Distributed datastore not required.</li>
							<li>Application-level data partitioning? Distributed datastore not required.</li>
							<li>Don't need low response latency? HTTP API-using options OK.</li>
							<li>Can re-initialize all data from external source? Datastores lacking backup method OK.</li>
							<li>Don't need to share the data with other instances? Embedded storage engine or database becomes an option. Authentication unnecessary.</li>
							<li>In a secure network? Can use datastores that lack TLS connection support.</li>
							<li>Only need primary key, no secondary, compound, etc. indexes? Key-value db.</li>
							<li>etc.</li>
						</ul>

						<h1>Many business requirements are strong restriction of options</h1>
					</section>
					<section>
						<ul>
							<li>Need data-at-rest encryption? Very few datastores.</li>
							<li>Federated Authentication? Most enterprise datastores, few non-enterprise datastores.</li>
							<li>Rapid restore of TB-sized backups? Filesystem snapshot methods are probably required.</li>
							<li>Point-in-time restore? Not many datastores.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>If it's in the DBA's hands they'll have to follow the rules above. All responsibility, no allowance for errors (except the sort billion-dollar vendors makes everyone suffer - you can't be fired for those.)</p>
						<p>Only the application developer (or spokesperson for them eg. System architect) can absolve them from needing these. Eg. We'll do the encryption, use CSE; we'll split records into tables that are live and allow older ones to be frozen to reduce backup restore work.</p>
